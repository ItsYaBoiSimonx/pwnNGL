Obviously, as previously mentioned, you will need the newest version of python downloaded off the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads) website ([and added to path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a3UOSBffUI)) to run this.

This tool is fully made in Python, it features active logging, a simple terminal-based UI and extremely fast request times!

This project also features a well-optimized proxy checker; it utilizes over 200 CPU threads to compute requests as fast as possible.

<h1 align="center">- USAGE -</h1>

Direct releases will be out very soon‚Ñ¢, but as of right now, you can just ```git clone``` the repository and manually run it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ItsYaBoiSimonx/pwnNGL
```
